# Module-17-Challenge  Credit_Risk_Analysis
# Overview of Project #
The purpose of this Project is to create a supervised machine learning model that could accurately predicts credit risk by using the credit card dataset from LendingClub, a peer-to-peer lending services company.Credit risk is an inherently unbalanced classification problem, as good loans easily outnumber risky loans.
Different techniques are used to train and evaluate models with unbalanced classes.

The analysis consisted of the following:
1. Resampling Models to Predict Credit Risk.
2. SMOTEENN Algorithm to Predict Credit Risk.
3. Ensemble Classifiers to Predict Credit Risk.

# Summary #
From our analysis, we were able to conclude that the following:
1. After analyzing the number of retiring employees by their titles, we were able to conclude that more than 60% of their employees are getting ready for retirement. The count of employees expected to retire is 90,398.
2. We were also able to conclude that the senior staff also had senior designations, which made sense.
3. We also realized that the highest number of Employees leaving were Senior Engineers and the Senior Staff. 
4. There appears to be a high numebr of employees retiring, hence the organization needs to backfill.
