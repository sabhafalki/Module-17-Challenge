# Module-17-Challenge  Credit_Risk_Analysis
# Overview of Project #
The purpose of this Project is to analyze the Employee DB so that we can help Pewlett Hackard company for the upcoming "Silver Tsunami". The goal is to anaylze the trend for the mass chunk of employees that are retiring soon. Pewlett Hackard wants detailed information on the number of future retirees from all departments currently working at the company, so that they can plan to hire new staff and prepare a mentorship initiative. The criterion was based on the birth dates ranging from 1952 to 1955 and hired dates from 1985 to 1988.

The analysis consisted of the following:
1. Identify the retiring employees by their title.
2. Determine the sum of retiring employees grouped by title.
3. Identify the employees eligible for participation in the mentorship program.
4. Determine the number of roles-to-fill grouped by title and department.
5. Determine the number of qualified, retirement-ready employees to mentor. the next generation grouped by title and department.

# Summary #
From our analysis, we were able to conclude that the following:
1. After analyzing the number of retiring employees by their titles, we were able to conclude that more than 60% of their employees are getting ready for retirement. The count of employees expected to retire is 90,398.
2. We were also able to conclude that the senior staff also had senior designations, which made sense.
3. We also realized that the highest number of Employees leaving were Senior Engineers and the Senior Staff. 
4. There appears to be a high numebr of employees retiring, hence the organization needs to backfill.
